# Human Activity Monitoring using Time Series Analysis and Graph Theory
The objective of this project is to extract time series features for human activity monitoring and visualizing the plots for different activities and body parts for 15 individuals

* **Task 1:**
  * Applying HVG(Horizontal Visibility Graph) and NVG(Natural Visibility Graph) to compute average degree, network diameter, and average path length. 
  * Tabulating all the data for different subjects (1-15) and axes for Head and Chest. 
  * Creating scatter plots for climbing up, climbing down, walking and running for head and chest in all directions (x,y,z)
* **Task 2:**
  * Computing Complexity and Permutation entropy for the data in all three directions (x, y, z)
  * Tabulating all the data for different subjects (1-15), axes, Embedded Dimensions (3,4,5,6) , Embedded Delay (1,2,3) and Signal Length(1024,2048,4096)
  * Creating scatter plots for climbing up, climbing down, walking and running for head and chest in all directions (x,y,z)

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [here](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/projects/activity-recognition/dataset/).

It provides human activity data for 15 subjects. Click on each subject to access the time series data. For this project accelerometer data for all the 15 subjects for walking, running, climbing up and climbing down are considered. 

The Human Activity data for 15 individuals for Climbing Up, Climbing Down, Walking and Running was used for the project. The project focuses on accelerometer sensor vibration in three directions (x,y,z). 


The data set  extracted covers the acceleration, data of the activities climbing stairs down and up, jumping, lying, standing, sitting, running/jogging, and walking of fifteen subjects. For each activity, the on-body positions chest, forearm, head, shin, thigh, upper arm, and waist were simultaneously recorded.
